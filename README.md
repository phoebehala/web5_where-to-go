## General Information

### Idea / Motivation
Finding places nearby is one of the most features I reply on in my real life.
As being not having good sense of direction, it's quite help when I can know where to go based on my current location.
That's why I'd like to buid an app which has similar features as the google map app.

### Purposes / Intentions
- To learn how to display the global map in react app
- To consolidate the usage of redux, useState, useRef
- To work with API and separate the file for it
- To become comfortable with styled-components

	
## Technologies Used

#### react.js
- react props, useState(), useRef(), react evnet

#### redux
- redux-toolkit

#### styles
- styled-components

#### other libraries

- antd
- google-map-react


## Features
#### To get the current location and places nearby from API
#### To find nearby places based on one or more categories
- Created a popover with pure react to implement above action
- Can also clicking the category in the list panel to find more related places
#### To display data on the map and the list simultaneously
- Showing the corresponding information in the list while clicking the pin on the map

<!--
